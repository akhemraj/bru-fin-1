# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic ERC721 token minting and transfer. It comes with a simple ERC721 contract, a UI for that contract interaction.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
